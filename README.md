https://challenge.nfhsnetwork.com/v2/search/events/upcoming?state_association_key=18bad24aaa&card=true&size=50&start=0

Using the JavaScript framework of your choice, implement a mobile-friendly JavaScript client application that does the following:

<!-- 1.  Returns the following fields for each item in the JSON in a table:
    Key, headline, subheadline, date. -->

<!-- 2.  Allows the user to change to the Texas State Association (UIL) using a dropdown menu and updates the results accordingly. The Texas State Association key is 542bc38f95. -->

3.  Allows the user to filter the events by date using a date picker.
    The API lets you filter on date using the from and to params. from=2021-02-20T21:00:00.000Z&to=2021-04-15T21:00:00.000Z

4.  Please provide instructions on how to run the code.

Below is a simple mock-up of the UI. Use the mock-up as basis to provide a well-styled and responsive result. Bonus Points: Use a similar look and feel as nfhsnetwork.com

When finished, please upload your code to GitHub or email it back to your recruiter.
